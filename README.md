# LyndenBellc-
The code for Lynden-Bell c- method. This method is dealing with truncated data to compute the luminosity function and redshift distribution.
It also consider the dependence of resdshift and Luminosity. It adopt the luminosity evolution as $L_0 = L / (1+z)^k$. You can see the follow references for more details.

# Useage
You are expected to define __Limit__ first. This class needs redshift, luminosity and limit. __Flim__ is the threshold of the data and it in unit 
of erg  cm$^-2$ s$^-1$.
