# LyndenBellc-
The code for Lynden-Bell c- method. This method is dealing with truncated data to compute the luminosity function and redshift distribution.
It also consider the dependence of resdshift and Luminosity. It adopt the luminosity evolution as \\(L_0 = L / (1+z)^k\\) distribution of redshift and luminosity.

If redshift and luminosity are not independent, you can transport k to represent the evolution of luminosity. You can also use testindependence() method to test the independence and this method 
also auto assign k.
